### Hi im sahil <p className="font-sometypemono italic hover:underline">aka sahiwl (pronounced same)</p>


hi, i am sahil (aka sahiwl on the internet) ~ currently a cs undergrad, a 20year old human being whose has keen interest in computers, dev, and a little bit of designing(i suck at it).
<br/>
Apart from tech and studies, im really into basketball (i played zonals and represented my school for ~4years in middleschool), a music enthusiast, i sometimes journal about things i cannot control (ocd was never my cue) and im really an ambivert ~&nbsp; _best of both words(introverts and extroverts)_ ig. And sometimes when im really really bored out of hell, i read (rarer than a haileys come im telling you right now). So, to abridge it all up, just a friendly neighborhood guy learning to stand up on his own knees, in life.

#### his'story

I started programming back in 2020 with python, learnt the basics, how to program a few basic programs and for some reason unbeknownst to me at that time, I stopped. As I finished high school, I studied sql and python (only because it was in my curriculum) and had the basic go of it, you know.

A few months later, i decided to give this a shot? Finally i came to my senses, and tried web-dev. Made the very obvious blunder of going through tutorial-hell, hated it when didn't understood basic dom-manipulation. Gave it up once again. huh.. 

but *There's more to the story than meets the eye-* 

you see, everyone eventually connects and finds a way to do get their shit together. so did i, and im kinda proud of the fact that this time when i tried it again - not only it made sense, but i was ,kind of enjoying the small wins. and no no, dont get me wrong by the very details of my moody-development journey~ im not some very genious or creative developer,&nbsp; *just a guy who enjoys writing code* and will get there, someday.
