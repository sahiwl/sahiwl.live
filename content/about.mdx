### Hi im sahil <p className="font-sometypemono italic hover:underline">aka sahiwl (pronounced same)</p>

I'm a CS final year student who's into coding, computers, and attempting design (still working on that last one). When I'm not programming, you'll find me playing basketball, surfing letterboxd, or occasionally reading.

<br/>

### journey

Started with Python in 2020, learned the basics, then... stopped for some reason. Picked it up again in high school through coursework, then discovered web development. 
<br/>
Started building small projects right away – a simple calculator, then a basic weather app that barely worked. They broke constantly, but that's how I learned. Each bug taught me something new about how things actually work under the hood.
Built a task manager that crashed when you added too many items, created a portfolio site that looked terrible on mobile, made a quiz app with memory leaks. But with each broken project, I got better at debugging, understanding fundamentals, and actually shipping something that works.
<br/>
I'm not claiming to be some coding prodigy – just someone who learns by building, breaking, and fixing. Each project gets a little better, and I can actually get things done now.
